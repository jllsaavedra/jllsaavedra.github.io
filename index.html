                            My favorite CMSC subject is CMSC 22 as I really enjoyed it and my instructor there is very lovable. <br><br>
                            For GE's, my favorite is KAS 1, because I find learning the history of our country very interesting. <br><br>
                            My current favorite programming language is Java as I really enjoyed object-oriented programming. <br><br>
                            My favorite food includes anything that is sweet! Most of the time, ice cream is my comfort food.
